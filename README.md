This is an app that learns from your examples and provides answers based on relative examples by using OpenAI (LLM and embeddings), Pinecone (Vectorstore), and Langchain.

## How does it work?

1. Create a .csv file with two columns, first one named 'input' and second one named 'output'
2. Enter in as many examples in the .csv file as you'd like
3. Upload the .csv file to the app
4. The examples are converted into embeddings and stored in the vector store (Pinecone)
5. When submitting a question, langchain is used to embed the input and do a semantic similarity search of the vector store, which returns the top 3 results as context
6. The LLM generates a response using the 3 examples as context
